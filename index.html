        <p>Blessed upon this earth on September 12th, 2016, &quot;Ollie&quot; The Pup had a furry face and bright blue eyes. 
          Upon visiting the breeder's home/kennel in mid-October there was a flurry of activity with floofy little Border Collie younglings 
          nipping at your shoe laces. Ollie stood out for his calmness and desire to be held. It was probably just a sleepy day,
          because upon the passage of time his energy has been a staple of his character. He is 1 water bottle tall(this will make sense in a moment).

        <h2 class="month">2 Months Old</h2>
        <p>It wasn't until a month later that Ollie moved in to our home. This is my roommate's dog legally to be clear! He was much bigger already and was quite a  whiney, little creature
          upon the arrival. From his perspective he had been taken from his family and was in an unknown place. He must have been dead set on
          trying to call out to his siblings for many hours each night when anyone within the house was trying to get sleep. It was so bad that
          one of my roommates went to his parent's house for the night. He seems to be 1 and 3/4 water bottles in height.

        <h2 class="month">3 Months Old</h2>
        <p>At 3 months old Ollie is starting to bulk up with continued growth all around. He has calmed down when being crated overnight for sleep.
          He despises being in his pen area while people are up and about. He has gained some height now being about 2 and 1/2 water battles tall.</p>

        <h2 class="month">4 Months Old</h2>
        <p>Keeping with the trend of growth, i'd say Ollie is over a half foot taller at 4 months! He's well over 3 water bottles tall now.
          Ollie has now developed the pesky habit of chewing on the corner of the living room rug.    </p>

        <h2 class="month">5 Months Old</h2>
        <p>At this point he has filled out in frame, but added a few more inches of height when sitting. With that extra ear perkiness Ollie is
           clocking in at 4 water bottles tall. Uh oh, now Ollie likes to take the hand towel hanging on the oven door and play with it.   </p>

        <p>After the 5 month mark it seemed like Ollie has reached his max size. He would come to develop quite the smattering of black spots on his
          snoot. He doesn't beg for food but will give you some investigative sniffs and glares when you do have something tasty cooking. Ollie can be left
        out and about alone over night and we won't have to worry about accidents on the floor, or anything items being torn up. He is the &quot;Goodboi&quot;.</p>
