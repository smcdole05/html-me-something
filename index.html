        <h2>1 Month Old</h2>
        <p>Blessed upon this earth on September 12th, 2016, &quot;Ollie&quot; The Pup had a furry face and bright blue eyes. 
          Upon visiting the breeder's home/kennel in mid-October there was a flurry of activity with floofy little Border Collie younglings 
          nipping at your shoe laces. Ollie stood out for his calmness and desire to be held. It was probably just a sleepy day,
          because upon the passage of time his energy has been a staple of his character.

        <h2>2 Months Old</h2>
        <p>It wasn't until a month later that Ollie moved in to our home. He was much bigger already and was quite a  whiney, little creature
          upon the arrival. From his perspective he had been taken from his family and was in an unknown place. He must have been dead set on
          trying to call out to his siblings for many hours each night when anyone within the house was trying to get sleep.
